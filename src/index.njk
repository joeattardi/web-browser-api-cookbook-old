  <h2>Web Browser API Cookbook</h2>

  <strong>Welcome!</strong>

  <p>
    This is the companion website for the upcoming book <em>Web Browser API Cookbook</em> by Joe Attardi. Each recipe from the
    book is expanded upon with a fully functional live demo, with all example code included.
  </p>

  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong>

  <p style="margin-top: 0;">
    The book, and this website, are both works in progress. Functioning examples are being added as the book is written, but
    there may be times where something is broken.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are having problems with the site or have any questions or feedback, please contact me 
    at <a href="mailto:jattardi@gmail.com">jattardi@gmail.com</a>.
